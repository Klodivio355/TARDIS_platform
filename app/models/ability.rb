  include CanCan::Ability

  def initialize(user)
    # Define abilities for the passed in users here. For example:

      # users ||= User.new # guest users (not logged in)
      # if users.admin?
      #   can :register, :all
      # else
      #   can :read, :all
      # end

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the users
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the users can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the users can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
