### Description
We wish to develop a tool to aid resourcing within the Clinical Trials Research Unit (CTRU). The end-vision is a working, on-line system that allows data managers to identify and allocate appropriate resource across a variety of tasks, manage and plan projects and timelines and allows users to record time spent on a task-by-task basis.

### Significant Features/Technology
The system has covered the most important features asked, combining a really good looking design.
The 1st prototype made half-way is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql89Td9Xx5Y&t=97s (no actual design)

The system is using Ruby on Rails and covers a solid Model/View/Controller structure in order to have a sustainable design.
Database related documentation is provided as well as some UML diagrams, story cards and Trello board.
